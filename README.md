# KISSViewer
A KISS image viewer made for OSX. This is a sort of base for image viewers, as it is very minimal and barebones.

### Features:
- A borderless rounded image window
- Lots of options
- Supports every format NSImageView supports (Which is alot)

### TODO:

- Better GIF support (NSImageView is bad with GIFS)
